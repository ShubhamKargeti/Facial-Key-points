# Facial-Key-points
predicting facial key points of an image using a CNN model
The model predict 64 coordinates of facial keypoints in an image using a 4 layer CNN model

This repository contains 4 notebooks
first notebook contain all preprocessing steps that we need to do before training our model
second notebook conatain the code for the training of the model
third notebook is about testing the model to preict the facial keypoints
last notebook contains the use of those keypoints in adding filter image on the source image
